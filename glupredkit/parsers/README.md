TO DO


### Limitations and Assumptions 

- Only a subset of 17 subjects have basal data because of an error that happened during data collection. Hence, we only include these subjects in the processing. 
- The age is noted in the dataset as an interval of 10 years. Since our dataset dictionary defines the age as a numeric type, we have used the midpoint value, because we argue that it is more important to preserve the information that the subject is an adult, rather than having the exact age value. 
- It is assumed that subjects using MiniMed 670G is using that with the SmartGuard function active
